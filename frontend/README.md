# The OpenVic Website Frontend
The frontend is pretty simple, using [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev) for the UI and routing. If you see something and think it could be a good change, feel free to either suggest it in #issues, the discord, or to simply fork the repo, make the change, and open a PR.

## Developing

All you need installed is NPM and a recent verion of NodeJS (LTS preffered)
To see the project, inside the `/frontend` folder run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Building

To build a production version in `/frontend/dist` run
```bash
npm run build
```
