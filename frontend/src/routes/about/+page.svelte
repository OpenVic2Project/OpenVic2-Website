<h1 id="top">About OpenVic2</h1>
<p>OpenVic2 aims to faithfully recreate Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness with a focus on enhancing performance, stability, and modability. We will support loading Victoria 2 mods with zero modifications in a classic / compatibility mode, which will be availible if you own a legitimate copy of Victoria 2. OpenVic2's default mode will be completely free, with our own graphics, content, data, and soundtrack, keeping the overall feel, playstyle, and balance as Victoria 2. OpenVic2 will have it's own modding api, allowing for extremely detailed and deep mods, while being easier to mod and easier for users to find and install mods. If you are interested in helping, see the contribute page, and if you want to stay up to date between dev diaries, check out <a href="https://www.github.com/OpenVic2Project/OpenVic2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GitHub</a> and join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vM4E3BFkqH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Discord</a>, we can't wait to get to know you.</p>
